Coursera Google Data Analytics Certifficate

##### This repository will contain my work for the Coursera course and capstone project of Coursera Google Data Analytics Certifficate.
Several RMD files with R code in RStudiowere uploaded, and for better readibility knits of RStudio in pdf were also duplicated.<br>
As in the course description, analytics-based scenario was chosen for this case study. The following  approach to act on the data from the scenario has been applied:ask questions, prepare, process, analyze, visualize and act . For capstone and case study please refer to [coursera course description](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone?specialization=google-data-analytics) and also [case study scenario](Capstone_Scenario_CaseStudy.pdf).

##### SQL work in Google Big Querry:

Utilisation of SQL skills has been practiced in Google Big Querry platform. Since my personal account has a file upload limitations I was not able to  upload my preperad csv file with cleaned dataframe. For the exercise purpose smaller file was uploaded (monthly data only) and the work was performed on this smoller dataset.
